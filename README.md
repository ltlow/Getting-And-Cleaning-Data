Getting-And-Cleaning-Data
=========================

This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.

Step 1 : Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
Step 2 : Make sure the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.
Step 3 : Use source("run_analysis.R") and run command in RStudio.
Note : Two output files will be generated in the current working directory.
           (1) first_dataset.txt (7.96 MB) : it contains a data frame with 10299*68 dimension.
           (2) tidy_dataset.txt (220 KB): it contains a data frame with 180*68 dimension.
